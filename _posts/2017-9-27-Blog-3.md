The Cover lesson

Dun Dun Dunâ€¦

* * *


With a cover lesson this week, there was no one to teach us coding, and thus, we didn't code instead we came up with the additional prices for our Google sheets. I came up with a few good ones like water, power and macaroni for the iguanas (iguanas like Mac and Cheese). I haven't worked on my blog at the time I am writing this but I intend to go to IT club to rectify my blog's recent issues and I hope to get my teacher to help me. Last week, I went to IT club but I didn't manage to fix the problems.
