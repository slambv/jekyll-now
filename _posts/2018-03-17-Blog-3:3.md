Just kidding, it's turtles

* * *


We continued working on our names this lesson. I am approximately halfway through writing my name in 2D,  to do this i have to retroactively change my previous code. I have three turtles and each one will do a dimension, turtle one has  done 1D, turtle 2 is doing 2D and turtle 3 will do 3D. I was less productive this lesson, but that was due to me investing a lot of time in an idea that ultimately failed, however I recovered from this and managed to calculate how to do many of my future work. Despite not having much physical work done this lesson, I have carefully considered how I am going to move forward.
