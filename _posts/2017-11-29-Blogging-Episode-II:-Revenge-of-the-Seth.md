Guess whos back?

* * *


We had a cover lesson this week. We used this lesson to finish our word-break-er-down-er for our cypher. Because I was already finished with the work from last week, I tried to do a bit extra for my encyherer, I tried to make a box where I could choose the cypher key, I didn't manage to figure it out. For my blog I did quite a bit (in 11 weeks!), when we are graded next I really hope to get a 6 or, if I'm lucky, even more
