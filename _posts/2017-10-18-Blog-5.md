Super Computers

* * *


In this lesson we learnt about supercomputers, in particular the Chinese supercomputer used to hack the US defence code. After discussing the speeds of this computer, we emphasised how fast it was by finding out it would take a thirteenth of a second to crack every 8 digit password in existence! Afterwards, I worked on my blog and I fixed it in time to be graded (thank God for that). I fixed my blog by deleting 1 digit from my whole code!
