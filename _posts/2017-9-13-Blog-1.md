Welcome to Year 9

______________________________________________

It gets harder everday

______________________________________________

So, new year : new blog! I'm using a different theme, so it will be very different from last year, different colors, new format and all that jazz. Anyway, the lesson, so, we’re learning how to use a spreadsheet in more advanced ways than I knew how to before. I’ve learnt how to add, multiply and locate values, this is so I can create a financial model.
