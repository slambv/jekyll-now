Not as slow as it sounds

* * *


We started work with turtles this week (not the animal but the coded drawing tool). Our first task was to create a square, i did this with relative ease as it was very simple, but then we had to create a triand which proved more difficult. Creating a triangle was difficult because we have to think of exterior angles as opposed to interior ones. With this newfound knowledge we created a pentagon using the same principles. We were then introduced to the penup()/pendown() functions. With all this information for turtles we then attempted to write our names, I didn't finish by the end of the lesson but i believe we will continue next week. By the time I reached the 'Tâ€™ i noticed other people were writing in block letters, had i done this from the start, my work would have been much more efficient.
